# E3Next

Automation Software using the MQ2Mono Plugin , written in C#. 

Was inspired by the original E3 written in the MQ macro language , and used as a prof of concept for the MQ2Mono plugin...

And well, it sort of took on a life of its own!

### Installation

You will first need the MQ2Mono installed. 

https://github.com/RekkasGit/MQ2Mono

More instructions to come on the install of E3N itself , currently for EMU you can use 

https://github.com/RekkasGit/E3NextAndMQNextBinary/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

This is for EMU only, I will setup instructions for live soon, but its not hard. 

Just copy the mono folder from root, and the E3 Ini folders in /config, and you should be good to go. Creating aprogram to do all this for you soon (tm)

To start issue.
