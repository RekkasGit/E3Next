/// This file, is the 'core', or the mediator between you and MQ2Mono
/// MQ2Mono is just a simple C++ plugin to MQ, which exposes the
/// OnInit
/// OnPulse
/// OnIncomingChat
/// etc
/// Methods from MQ event framework, and meshes it in such a way to allow you to write rather straight forward C# code.
///
/// Included in this is a Logging/trace framework, Event Proecssor, MQ command object, etc
///
/// Your class is included in here with a simple .Process Method. This methoid will be called once every OnPulse from the plugin, or basically every frame of the EQ client.
/// All you code should *NOT* be in this file.
